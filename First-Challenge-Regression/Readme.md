Linear Regression - California Housing Prices
Introduction
This project challenges your programming and data analysis skills to predict housing prices in California. Unlike typical projects, we will not provide you with the dataset directly. You will need to find the "California Housing Prices" dataset on your own, using online platforms that store datasets. This approach will familiarise you with crucial resources for any data scientist or developer interested in data analysis.
Objectives
●	Develop skills in searching for and managing datasets. 
●	Implement a linear regression model for predictive analysis.
●	Apply programming knowledge in a data science context. 
General Instructions 
●	You can choose any programming language to develop this Project. 
●	Ensure that you follow the best practices and coding standards relevant to the language you choose. 
●	You must properly manage the data.
●	Ensure that your code is robust and free of execution errors. 
Mandatory Part
●	Project Name: linear_regression
●	Files to submit: Depending on the programming language you choose, include all necessary source files.
●	Description: Your project should be able to load the "California Housing Prices" dataset from a CSV file, properly process the data, fit a linear regression model, and calculate metrics to evaluate the model's performance
Remember! Performing a descriptive and visual analysis of the data is always very helpful. It will be useful to familiarize yourself with terms such as data normalization, training data, and validation data. How exciting!
